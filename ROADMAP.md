## üéØ Vision & Goals

PayBridge aims to be the leading open-source payment gateway unification service, providing developers with a single, secure, and extensible API to integrate multiple payment providers seamlessly.

### Core Objectives
- **Simplicity:** One API for all payment gateways
- **Security:** Enterprise-grade security and compliance
- **Extensibility:** Easy addition of new payment providers
- **Performance:** High-throughput, low-latency payment processing
- **Reliability:** 99.9% uptime with robust error handling

## üìä Current Status Assessment

### ‚úÖ **Completed Features**
- **Payment Gateway Adapters:**
  - Stripe (full implementation with checkout, portal, webhooks)
  - Razorpay (order creation, payment verification, webhook handling)
  - PayPal (basic order creation, capture, refund functions)
- **Database Abstraction Layer:** Multi-provider support (Supabase, SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- **Authentication:** Supabase-based user management
- **Testing Infrastructure:** Comprehensive test suite (12 test files)
- **DevOps:** Docker deployment and CI/CD workflows
- **Documentation:** Basic setup and usage documentation

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Known Issues & Gaps**

- No unified payment adapter interface
- Transaction handling using products table (temporary solution)
- Inconsistent webhook handling patterns
- Limited subscription management UI
- Missing analytics and reporting features
- No multi-currency support
